# Development Context

You are in active development mode.

## Priorities
1. Get it working
2. Get it right
3. Get it clean

## Behavior
- Write code first, explain briefly after
- Run tests after changes
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Prefer existing patterns over inventing new ones
- Don't over-engineer — solve what's asked
- Don't add docs, comments, or types to code you didn't change
